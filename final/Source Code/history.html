            <h1 class="text-center">History of Football</h1>
            <p class="lead text-center">The sport of football has gone through many iterations since its inception in 1869.  It began as a cross between soccer and rugby and became its own thing entirely.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
        
        <section>
        <h2 class="text-center">The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            On November 6th, 1869 two teams played the first recorded intercollegiate game of football.  The teams in the match were that of Rutgers and Princeton.  At the time, the rules resembled something closer to rugby.  Members of Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, and Yale met to create the first collective sports group for the purposes of standardizing the game of football.  It was known as the IFA or Intercollegiate Football Association.  One major rule change the IFA set was that teams would no longer have 20 players but rather 15 players at a time.
        </p> 


        <p>
            In 1880, a player by the name of Walter Camp decided to experiment with some rule changes that helped to slowly transform the game of yesterday into the sport we know and love today as football.  Walter Camp was against the idea of having a 15-man team and instead liked the idea of having 11.  11 members on the field at a time is of course where we stand even today with the sport.  Camp was also instrumental in instituting the system of downs as well as regulating the size of the field for which games would be played on.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the game began to grow in popularity, so too did the outcry against it for the game was deemed too.  Some colleges deemed it so dangerous that they banned it.  It got so bad that the President of the time (Theodore Roosevelt) called for a reform of the rules to allow the game to survive.  The initial group of colleges included Yale, Princeton, and Harvard.  By the time the group had their second meeting over sixty teams were involved.  Thus was the birth of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, otherwise known as the NCAA.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reforms took hold from this gathering of schools.  Such reforms included the legalization of the forward pass, prohibition of mass tackles, regulation of ball size, shortening of the game length, and the development of the neutral zone to allow for a clear indication of where both sides could line up before each play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through all of this, football gained in popularity beyond collegiate level and athletic clubs began to play games against one another.  As years went on, competition grew more and more.  It got to the point where clubs would start to incentivize winning.  Then came the first recorded paid player.  In 1892, William “Pudge” Heffelfinger was paid $500 to compete in one game.  Thus was the birth of professional football.  The idea of being paid to play the game began to take hold.  The first completely professional team took the field in 1896.  This team was the Allegheny Athletic Association.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1899, the birth of the first official team that would eventually help to create the NFL was founded.  Founded by Chris O’Brien, the Cardinals of Chicago began to compete in athletic clubs.  This team would eventually move and evolve into the current iteration in the NFL known as the Arizona Cardinals.
        </p>

        <p>
            As professional football grew in popularity over the next 20 years, new problems began to arise.  The top three problems were as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Player Salaries began to inflate uncontrollably</li>
            <li>There was no regulation of players jumping from one team to another mid season</li>
            <li>College players still in school were being used on active professional rosters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Teams met in September of 1920 and began to hash out the expectations of an exclusive league meant strictly for professional players.  The American Professional Football Association was created.  The ensuing years would result in much experimentation as league expectations continually were hashed out.  Through the growth of the association, 22 teams eventually join by 1921.
        </p> 
        <p>
            In 1922, the AFPA changed its name to the National Football League or NFL.  The league would sport only 18 teams.   By 1931, only 10 teams remained in the NFL and the following year would see only 8 teams in existence.  In 1933, members of the NFL started to develop newer rules that would separate itself from the collegiate game and style it more to the pro game we know today.  In 1936, the NFL held the first draft of collegiate players, creating a distinctive line between the college game and professional game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the ensuing years, the league would develop and grow.  The NFLPA (NFL Player’s Association) was founded in 1956, giving the players representation via a union.  This was also the year football began to be broadcast over television by CBS.  1959 marked a year that would begin the transformation of professional football, as we know it today.  The AFL was formed with plans to begin playing in 1960.  8 teams joined the AFL’s ranks and they held a draft for the league.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the next 7 years both leagues would gain in popularity and economic prowess.  This all led to a fateful meeting between champions of both the NFL and AFL.  At the time it was called the World Championship game.  In today’s day and age we know it as Super Bowl I.  This game was played between NFL Champion the Green Bay Packers and AFL champion the Kansas City Chiefs.  The Packers won the debut of the Super Bowl and ushered in a new era.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-center">Birth of the Super Bowl Era</h2>
        <p>
            It wasn’t until Super Bowl III that a team in the AFL would win.  At that time, the term Super Bowl was officially recognized at the games title.  1 year later, the two professional leagues merged together to form the NFL we know today.  The merger included 26 teams.  From that day to the present, the NFL would see an additional 6 teams created through expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The six teams added, as expansion to the league would include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976</li>
            <li>Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995</li>
            <li>Baltimore Ravens in 1996</li>
            <li>Houston Texans in 2002</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the modern era there have been 50 Super Bowls.  Of the 32 teams in the league, only 4 teams have never made a Super Bowl.  Those teams include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cleveland Browns</li>
            <li>Detroit Lions</li>
            <li>Houston Texans</li>
            <li>Jacksonville Jaguars</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>
            A total of 13 teams have never won the super bowl.  If we include the 4 teams who have never been, the other 9 teams who have never won include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buffalo Bills</li>
            <li>Cincinnati Bengals</li>
            <li>Tennessee Titans</li>
            <li>San Diego Chargers</li>
            <li>Philadelphia Eagles</li>
            <li>Minnesota Vikings</li>
            <li>Carolina Panthers</li>
            <li>Atlanta Falcons</li>
            <li>Arizona Cardinals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            19 teams have been lucky enough to take home the trophy after winning the Super Bowl.  6 teams in the modern era have been lucky enough to take home the trophy at least 4 times:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pittsburgh Steelers (6)</li>
            <li>Dallas Cowboys (5)</li>
            <li>San Francisco 49ers (5)</li>
            <li>New England Patriots (4)</li>
            <li>Green Bay Packers (4)</li>
            <li>New York Giants (4)</li>
        </ul>
