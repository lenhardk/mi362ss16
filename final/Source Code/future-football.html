                Football has had a storied history.  It has gone throughmany iterations.  Some evolution of the game has spawned from fear of brutality.  As science advances, new concerns may have football's future in jeopardy.

        <h2 class="text-center">Where is football "headed"?</h2>
        <p>
            The nature of the game of football has always come with the idea of evolution and change.  In the beginning it was the development of rules that helped to liven the game up and reduced some of the brutality.  Through the years, new rules and increases to player equipment and regulations changed the idea of safety within the game.  Players began getting stronger and faster.  This resulted in more rule changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently the NFL modified rules to the kickoff, a common play in which the opposing team kicks to the return team for one play to try and accrue as many yards as possible before their set of downs.  The NFL has increased where the ball is kicked off, resulting in a diminished number of returns.  The kickoff is considered one of the most dangerous plays in the game, as there is a lot of field to build up a lot of momentum for some catastrophic collisions.   Analysts say that before long, the play itself will be eliminated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the NFL is doing everything it can to outlaw hits above the shoulders on players.  A much more concerted attempt to protect the heads of players has been pushed forth.  Recently, however, more research has been coming to light around a medical condition known as CTE.  CTE stands for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.  It is a degenerative disease that results from repeated head/brain trauma.  Any athlete that experiences trauma to the head is susceptible to this disease.  Many links have been found between soccer players and head issues.  No other sport more so than football, however, have players been found to be more susceptible to CTE.
        </p>
        <p>
            There have been a string of older players passing away in younger years.  Many autopsies have found evidence of CTE.  Many retired players have also experienced problems with substance abuse and depression.  Some question whether there is a link between retired players change in disposition and CTE.  Currently there is no way to diagnose CTE without performing an autopsy.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the findings of CTE, many players have become more conscious of football’s prolonger affects.  In recent years the NFL has seen an uptick in the number of top-level talent players that are retiring at or before the age of 30.  Whether there is a correlation between recent scientific findings and this movement or not remains to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NFL has been placed in the spotlight with regards to CTE, and it hasn’t been the most flattering light.
